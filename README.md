Color Quantization and Image processing
This project consists of 3 main parts:
1.	Implement color quantization of the image in 2 colors spaces (RGB and L*a*b*) using 3 different kinds of algorithms:
"	kmeans: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering
"	median-cut: https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~dcor/Graphics/cg-slides/color_q.pdf
"	octree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree

2.	Visualize the color theme palettes and quantized images 

3.	Complete objective image quality assessment (IQA) of the original image and quantized images in two color spaces (RGB and L*a*b*) with 4 different methods:
"	Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation (GMSD): https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.3052.pdf
"	Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio
"	Structural Similarity (SSIM): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity
"	Visual Information Fidelity (VIF): http://utw10503.utweb.utexas.edu/publications/2005/hrs_vidqual_vpqm2005.pdf
